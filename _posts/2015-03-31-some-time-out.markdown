Every now and then in life we need some time out.

I have found teaching to be quite exhausting physically and mentally. As of this week I have put my teaching career on hold for the year and I am taking time out to travel for a few months.

From September 2015 onwards I will be back at work with renewed focus, energy and enthusiasm to tackle all things web.

Send me an email to request an estimate and you could be the first cab off the rank, so to speak!
