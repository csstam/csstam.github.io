The year 2014 involved some epic changes for me and marked the start of my genuine move from teaching into web development. I have appreciated the support of friends and colleagues in making this career move.

Since starting in web development I have experienced a steep but fun learning curve. I have learned a great deal more about HTML, CSS, liquid layouts and version control than previously; and have expanded my working knowledge of wordpress.


I have worked with some fantastic clients and am throughly looking forward to the adventures and experiences that the coming year has to offer.

If you are looking at getting a site made or if you are looking to hire a dev for some overflow work, drop me a line!
